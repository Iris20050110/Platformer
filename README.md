## Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:
```
npm start
```
The app runs in the development mode. You can open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

```
npm run build
```
This builds the app for production by generating the build folder. Now the app would be ready for deployment.
